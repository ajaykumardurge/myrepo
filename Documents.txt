1.read command 
 
The read command reads one line from standard input and assigns the value of each field in the input line to ashell a variable useing the charecters.

we make any shellscript interactive mood using read command.

First Example : write a shellscript accept the username from the person and you have display back in the same 

echo " please enter your name"
read name
echo "the name which you have entered:"$name

second Example : write a shellscrift for display one user variable using array.

echo "please enter the devopstools"
read -a devopstools
echo " the devops tools which you are typed one:"{$devopstools[*]}
echo "the 5th devops tools from your input is:"${devopstools[4]}

where '-a' is the array
we are using number of values instad of using the variable array

example :

 read -p "enter the your bank user name:"username
 read -sp "please enter the bank password:"password
 echo "username which you have typed is:"$username
 echo "the password which you have typed is:"$password



2.expalaining the pipe commands and usages

Pipe is used to combine two or more commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command, 
and this commandâ€™s output may act as input to the next command and so on.
It can also be visualized as a temporary connection between two or more commands/ programs/ processes. 

ls -is a list of files 
wc -l how many words and how many lines in the list

The pipe has much functionality used to filter, sort, and display the text in the list. 
One of the common examples is described here.
Suppose we have a file named file1.txt having the names of the students. 
We have used the cat command to fetch the record of that file.
example : 
Ajay
mahesh
zeera
fatima
nexus
india

the data present in this files unodered so to sort the data, we need to fallow a piece of code

$ cat files.txt|sort

through the respective output , you can see names are arraged alphabatically in sequence of a to z


4. how to check current shell

echo $0
ps -p$$
echo $shell


5.command line arguments
 
while executing the shellscrifts passing the values through command promt is called " command line arguments"

can i pass n number of arguments ?
 yes it is possible but each arguments separated by the space

example : sh arguments.sh argname1  argname2

echo $1
echo $2
echo $3
echo $4
.
.
.
.
if arguments is above 1 digit
echo ${10}.


example : shellscript for command line arguments

if[$# -eq 2]
echo "scrift file name" $0
echo "first arg " $1
echo "second arg " $2
echo "third arg " $3
echo "10 th arg " ${10}
echo "number of args" $#
echo "all the args"$*
echo "all the args"$@
echo "PID"$$
date
echo "privious command execution status"$?
fi


5.control commands -if

systax 

if condition
then
display commands list if condtion is true
else
disply commands list if condtion is false 
fi

1.example :write a shellscipt find the which number is bigger from the two numbers
a=10,b=20

if[$a -gt $b]
then
echo "$a is bigger than $b"
else
echo"$b is bigger than $b"
fi.
